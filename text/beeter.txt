What's Going On

This variation of the Beet-er Late Than Never Burger is made with an 80/20 beef patty, pickled red beets, fresh beet greens, grilled vidalia onions, fried goat cheese (obviously), and golden beet mostarda on a brioche bun.

Long burdened with an unrelenting resilience, the Beet-er has carved pitiless valleys through glorious mountain ranges, while punching wells deep into the mantle of Earth. The same fate will befall the dire souls attempting to devour this burger.

Comes with fries and balsamic aioli.
