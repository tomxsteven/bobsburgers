Fair Warning to the Home Chef

These burger recipes have no ingredient amounts, they have generalized ratios (see baker percentage). Hand holding will be kept to a minimum. You are going to have to dust off some extra gumption to successfully execute these recipes. The prep lists are organized in a recommended standard operating procedure - but do whatever you want, it's your party.

Always know where your towels are - and try not cut, stab, burn, break, crush, hit, insult, or poison yourself and others.

And stop going to restaurants, unless you tip the cooking staff well.

Scratch that, go support your local family run street vendors! Destroy restaurant culture! Make your own food and eat the rich! Become the change you seek! We need more Belchers in this world!

¡Viva la Revolución!

Okay. Bon appétit.
