      <p style="margin-top: 3%;">These recipes do not include specific amounts or measurements. The instructions are intentionally vague to create a sense of familiarity and/or fear. Normally, my recipes are basic ingredients lists and doodles haphazardly scribbled on parchment paper. There is more than enough information provided to complete this challenge.</p>
      <p> You'll need to incorporate your own style and techniques onto the structure of these recipes to produce a successful product. Think of this outline like a kitchen version of html.</p>
      <p>If you fail, eat it your failure (don't waste food), and then try again.<br>If you complete the objective, you're a proper cook.<br>If you can teach someone else how to do it, you're a chef.</p>

    <h3>Letter to the Chefs:</h3>
      <p>You should be playing on Boss Mode.</p>
      <p>Full disclosure, I pooped out this recipe for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> around 3am while watching Bob's Burgers. Although I haven't made the dang thing yet, I'm pretty sure this burger will be fine. The flavors are there, and it has just enough pizzazz to pique interest. Additionally, it's hipster-friendly fanfare and pairs with alcohol. So it will sell.</p>
      <p>Even if it <em>is</em> a lamb burger. It has to be lamb burger (or wild game). Stop catering to the lowest common denominator. If you use beef instead of lamb, turn in your chef sash and bib, you're done. And yes, yes there's vodka in the pickle brine. I don't care. It will work. I promise. I can feel it.</p>
      <p> There are solid methods in this outline, if you know where to look. You're just going to have to trust me.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later:</p>
      <p>Boom. <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-make-whiskey-pickles/">Whiskey Pickles</a>. There is a precedent.</p>
    <h3>One last thing for everyone else:</h3>
      <p>Wake up.<br>Destroy restaurant culture.<br>Support small, poor, family-run vendors.<br>Grow and preserve your own food.<br>Feed your community.</p>
      <p>Eat the rich.</p>
      <p>Love,</p>
      <p>Chef Tom</p>
