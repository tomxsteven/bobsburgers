    <h2>Letter to the Chef</h2>
    <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
    <p>This recipe feels like it was taken from the staff cookbook of an illegal back alley bistro. There are no amounts or measurements, and the instructions are vague to confuse uninitiated management. However, any cook worth their salt should be able to put this burger combo together with time to spare.</p>
    <p>Using the recipes provided, challenge yourself to make this burger combo within the alloted time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two hours to mise en place</li>
      <li>Eight minutes to execute the dish</li>
      <br>
      <li>Extra credit: Make the potato buns lol</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will have to incorporate your own style and techniques into the recipe's structure to produce a successful dish.</p>
    <p>Bon app√©tit,</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 5%;">-Chef Tom</p>
