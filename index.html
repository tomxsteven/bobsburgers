    <h3>Letter to the Chefs:</h3>
      <p>You should be playing on Boss Mode.</p>
      <p>Full disclosure, I pooped out this recipe for the Odin Project around 3am while watching Bob's Burgers. Although I haven't made the dang thing yet, I'm sure the burger will be fine. The flavors are there, and it has just enough pizzazz to pique interest. Additionally, it's a hipster-friendly dish that pairs with alcohol. So it will sell.</p>
      <p>Even if it's a lamb burger. It has to be lamb burger. Stop catering to the lowest common denominator. If you use beef instead of lamb, turn in your chef sash and bib, you're done. And yes, there's vodka in the pickle brine. I don't care what you think, it will work. I promise. I can feel it.</p>
      <p> There are solid methods in this outline. You're just going to have to trust me.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later:</p>
      <p>Boom.<a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-make-whiskey-pickles/">Whiskey Pickles</a>. There is a precedent.</p>
    <h3>One last thing for everyone else:</h3>
      <p>Destroy restaurant culture.<br>Support small, family-run vendors.<br>Grow your own food.<br>Feed your community.</p>
      <p>Eat the rich.</p>
      <p>Love,</p>
      <p>Chef Tom</p>
